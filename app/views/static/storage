Once upon a time I was an aerospace engineer, although I wasn't a pure programmer back then, my works involve a lot of programming.
Projects range from PID controller simulation, convex optimization to finite element analysis all utilize software extensively.
You can see a movement where scientist and engineer try to descretize their model into linear algbera form, such that software can do the heavy lifting.
Convex optimization in particular, it's literally the embodiement of the human trial and error process.
The program cacluate the error growth rate between each step then try to navigate in the design space in such way that minize error.
Anyway I'm getting sidetrack thinking about convex optimization.
It was at time, my interest in programming was kindle.
But it wasn't until when one of my manager ask me to program some VBA optimizer for him, then I really start considering it as a career.
Back then I alwasy thought programming is some sort of esoteric art that require a 4 years degree before you can start write a line of code.

Every step in an engineering process is gradually being replace by software automation. Need to optimze your design? no problem, convex optimization
Need to analyze the stress of a structure in a complex loading scheme? no problem, Ansys that shit out. Don't know what construction material to pick? CESS selector.

In most other career, the difference between good performer and a bad performer is at most 200% difference. A good taxi driver can at most perform 200% better than the worst taxi driver.
But for programming, the difference between the best and worst can be several order of magntitude.
